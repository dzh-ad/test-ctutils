CT Utils
========

CT utils is a set of simple tools for analyzing data in CT scans. Currently the
project supports scans in TXM format (as produced by Xradia products), VGI
format (as produced by ??? products), and TIFF stacks.

At the moment, the project's goal is to produce a set of simple command line
tools for batch processing of CT scans, and an API to permit easy access to
scan data from Python.
